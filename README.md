# Movie Recommender System using NLP

## Overview
This project implements a movie recommender system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system analyzes movie descriptions and user input to recommend movies that match the user's preferences. It utilizes NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for text processing, including tokenization, stemming, and stop words removal. The web application is built using Streamlit and deployed on the Streamlit platform for easy access.

## Features
- Tokenization: Breaks down movie descriptions into individual words or tokens.
- Stemming: Reduces words to their root form to normalize the text.
- Vectorization: Converts text data into numerical form for analysis.
- Stop Words Removal: Eliminates common words that do not carry significant meaning.
- User Input Processing: Accepts user preferences and suggests relevant movies.
- Web Application: Provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the recommender system.
- Streamlit Deployment: Hosted on the Streamlit platform for accessibility.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- NLTK
- Streamlit
